# nanogenmo2016
My nanogenmo2016 entry. It's written in Python 2.7.10. I'm going with a story compiler approach, as shown by [cpressey](https://gist.github.com/cpressey/6324fff6ef0dfdf69b96).

I'm going for an extremely violent world, here. Just for fun, I suppose. Murder, drugs, blackmail, more!
This is going to be crime stories - not crime stories as in a crime thriller, but just a narration of a whole bunch of people dying and killing and so forth.

I have a structure set up:
- Plot of crimes generated
- Plot turned into event structures
- Random characters generated
- Event structures filled out with random characters and generated sentences
- [MAYBE] Generated stories in LaTeX format, turned into PDF

I've already set up a plot generator. I'm probably going to use [Faker](https://github.com/joke2k/faker) to generate my character names. I'm also going to custom code some sentence templates, and use random words to fill them in. Then process them in LaTeX to create my sick 50k extremely violent book!
