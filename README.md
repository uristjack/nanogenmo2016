# nanogenmo2016
My nanogenmo2016 entry. It's written in Python 2.7.10. I'm going with a story compiler approach, as shown by [cpressey](https://gist.github.com/cpressey/6324fff6ef0dfdf69b96).

I'm going for an extremely violent world, here. Just for fun, I suppose. Murder, drugs, blackmail, more!
This is going to be crime stories - not crime stories as in a crime thriller, but just a narration of a whole bunch of people doing crimes and getting victimized. Specifically, two people - just in a couple thousand alternate timelines. This makes character generation a LOT easier - what can I say? I'm lazy. And this is also technically interesting.

This was my original structure set up:
- Plot of crimes generated
- Plot turned into event structures
- Random characters generated
- Event structures filled out with random characters and generated sentences
- [MAYBE] Generated stories in LaTeX format, turned into PDF

This is my current structural set up:
- Plot of crimes generated [DONE!]
- Event template (AKA plot) turned into paragraph templates [DONE!]
- Paragraph templates turned into sentence templates
- Sentence templates cause generation of actual sentences, in LaTeX output
- Turn LaTeX output into PDF

Since this _is_ a multiversal crime timeline narrator, I may also end up writing some code to generate some ad-hoc scientific explanation for how we can see these timelines. I find this good for two reasons - one, it's amusing to have a computer breaking the fourth wall, and two, it'll be a nice change from coding the generators of scenes of Tarantino-esque blood, gore, and violence.
