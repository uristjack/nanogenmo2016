# nanogenmo2016
My nanogenmo2016 entry. It's written in Python 2.7.10. I'm going with a story compiler approach, as seen by https://gist.github.com/cpressey/6324fff6ef0dfdf69b96.

I'm going for an extremely violent world, here. Just for fun, I suppose. Murder, drugs, blackmail, more!
This is going to be crime stories - not crime stories as in a crime thriller, but just a narration of a whole bunch of people dying and killing and so forth.
